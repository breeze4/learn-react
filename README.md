This is the code for [this course on React](https://www.udemy.com/learn-and-understand-reactjs/) at Udemy. Stephen Grider is the instructor and it's a great course.

The code is complete for the course as it was when I went through it. Stephen updates it to keep it current with ongoing development of React, Flux and React Router.
